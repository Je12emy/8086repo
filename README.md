# 8086repo
This repository contains .asm code I use for a college course.

If you are visiting this repo and you are trying to learn .asm concepts feel free to clone, fork, collaborate or ask any questions!

If you are a student from Mr.Sanabria's class on "Arquitectura de Computadoras II", I created this repo in order to help my classmates understand programming concepts on the Emu8086, certain files are not my own code but rather some of my classmate's code which I asked if I could share on this repo.

I also documented several clases on a my OneNote if you want a more detailed explanation on certain concepts.

Please remember to use this repo as resourse for your classes and not to commit fraud, I will take down this repo if asked by Mr. Sanabria, play fare and hopefully future students will have access to this resourse I made with the purpose of helping my classmates, thanks!

Feel free to ask me any questions or collaborate on any files I would love for this repo to continue growing.
